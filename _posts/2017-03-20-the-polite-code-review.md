## The Polite Code Reviewer

### Read the code

Seems obvious,
but normally we just check the diffs
and end up losing context
on how and why
the implemetation was made

### Enphasize the goods before bashing the bads

As alien as it may appear
the main concern of the code reviewer
should be to emphasize the good stuffs,
so they keep poping up.

#### Now, bash the bads as hell

You SHOULD,
or even: IS OBLIGATED to
bash the not so fine stuff.
But I believe in a proper way to do this.

##### Never say that something is plain ugly
##### When something is wrong, you should say how
Github markdown and all of it
is amazing to create really readable texts
with code syntax highlighting and everything.
So use it.
Give examples,
use references to older experiences and blog posts.
Try and prove your point.
