## TL;DR

_On programming:_
I learned a bit about elm (I'm really liking it)
and was remembered that programmers
like me and (maybe) you
can face jail time if we "just do what we have being told to".

_On general:_
I have watched and listened to some things on
how to lead and get things done.

_On waking the mind:_
I saw some nice stuff around Bill Murray's way of life.
