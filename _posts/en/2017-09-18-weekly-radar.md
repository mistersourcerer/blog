## TL;DR for this week links

_On programming (& the field):_

I've read a nice piece on product management,
and also found an Open Source web project around small food growers. Nice!

_On general:_

I finished (not this week, to be honest) a awesome Stephen King book, go for it!

_On waking the mind:_

Besides searching for delicious recipes,
I'm allways saying that work is "just" work.
Stumbled upon a Philosopher called Andrew Taggart
who has some very nice words
to explain my strange thoughts.
