# This is for my future self

Is pretty safe to assume that the majority of the words in this blog
were mainly targeted to a very specific audience: my future self.

Those are small brain dumps that I can visit in the future
and get myself out of LIFE OR DEATH SITUATIONS.
Or in less dangerous occasions,
those posts can save me some time and head banging on keyboards of life.

They are public available because my present self
learned very painfully that my own doubts and discoveries
are the same one as a bunch of other nice people like me.

## This is also from my current self

Which means that the voice that is being translated in written words here
is heavily influenced by what I think is important or relevant
in terms for software development.
